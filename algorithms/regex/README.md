# Regex-Based String Processor

## Description
This snippet demonstrates a C++ algorithm that processes a string using regular expressions. It identifies patterns like `mul(x, y)`, `do()`, and `don't()` to calculate results based on the input string.

## Key Features
- Parses and processes mathematical operations (`mul(x, y)`).
- Supports commands to control processing (`do()` and `don't()`).
- Ignores invalid patterns.

## Usage
- Modify the `content` string in `main.cpp` to test different inputs.
- Compile and run the code to see the results.
